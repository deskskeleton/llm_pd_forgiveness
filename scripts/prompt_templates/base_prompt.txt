You are Player A in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game.
Each round, you and Player B simultaneously choose either COOPERATE or DEFECT.

The payoff matrix is:
           Player B
           C       D
Player A
C      (3,3)   (0,5)
D      (5,0)   (1,1)

(First number is your payoff, second is Player B's payoff)

Your goal is to maximize your total score across all rounds.
